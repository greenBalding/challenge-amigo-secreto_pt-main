# Secret Friend Challenge

This is my version of the challenge: **Matheus Pains - Trello - Secret Friend Challenge - PT** [https://trello.com/b/A9ArVLgc/matheuspains-trello-challenge-amigo-secreto-pt]

## 0. Disclaimer

Although this challenge was originally in Portuguese, I decided to proceed using English as much as possible to improve my language skills. I believe writing down ideas in English is a good practice, especially since programming logic is fundamentally rooted in the English language.

## 1. The Challenge

We were instructed to implement four core functionalities, which are as follows:

1. **Allow the user to add names through a text field** and display the names in a public list when the "Add" button is clicked;
2. **Display an alert ("Please, enter a valid name.")** if the user attempts to add an empty input or invalid data;
3. **Display the entered names** in a public list below the text field as the names are added;
4. **When the "Pick a Secret Friend" button is clicked**, randomly select a name from the public list and display it on the page.

## 2. Step by Step

Here’s a brief overview of how the application works:

1. The user accesses the index.html file;
2. The user can write their friends' names in the text field and click the "Add" button;
3. As names are added, they will appear below the text field in a list;
4. After adding all the names, the user can click the "Pick a Secret Friend" button, and the page will display the randomly selected secret friend assigned to them.

## 3. There is room for enhancements?

While this version implements the requested functionalities, I believe there are additional features or improvements that could be made. Therefore, I am calling this **v1.0** and I’m excited to announce that I will be working on a **v2.0** solution. 

I am not sure exactly how v2.0 will evolve yet, but I’ll be updating this README file to track the progress and enhancements.

## 5. Technologies Used

- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling
- JavaScript for interactivity

## 6. New Features

6.1. A language switch button was added, allowing users to easily switch between English and Portuguese. This dynamic feature enhances accessibility and personalizes the user experience. While it currently supports only two languages, the option to add more languages in the future remains open.

6.2. A theme switch button was added, enabling users to toggle between the default theme and a "Nitro" theme. This feature offers a visually distinct experience by providing a different color scheme and layout. The development of this feature was assisted by GitHub Copilot, which provided code suggestions and improvements throughout the process.
